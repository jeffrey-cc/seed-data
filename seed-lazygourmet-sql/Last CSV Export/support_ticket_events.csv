You can choose to have a private station – available only for your use at any time and storage for your belongings. Alternatively, you can choose to share a station and reduce costs – this limits your flexibility a little bit as only one company is allowed to use the station at a time, but is a perfect opportunity for new starts or for businesses who don’t need as much time in the kitchen. We work to find people who agree to access the kitchen at different times and days. The storage space and cooler space that is included in the station are also then shared between the two parties.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo enhance our collaborative environment, we have a philosophy to try our best to avoid direct competitors in the same facility. We strive to provide a safe & professional platform and collaborative work environment for small business owners to start, grow and scale their food businesses.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe have added you to our mailing list to keep you up to date on all news relevant to Local Food and our Commissary.

No worries at all!\\n\\n \\n\\nI wanted to reach out via email to see if we could schedule a time for you to come in for a tour of our facilities. Seeing the space in person is truly the best way to get a feel for how Commissary Connect can support your business and see all our offerings firsthand.\\n\\n \\n\\nWould you be available sometime next week for a visit? Please let me know what days or times work best for you, and I'll do my best to accommodate.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the meantime here is some information about us and what we offer our Community of Entrepreneurs:\\n\\n \\n\\nOur multiple facilities are tied together with Commissary Connect technology that works for our members in booking appliances on-line, managing the kitchen’s assets, and easy to understand monthly invoices (makes your bookkeeping easy!), details of your team’s access and appliance usage, and many other features. On a tour, we will show you how our system works.\\n\\nHere is some general information:\\n\\n All of our facilities offer:\\n\\n \\n\\n24/7 Access with keypad entrances (never worry about losing a key or fob)\\nVancouver Coastal Health Approval\\nAmple Prep and Hand Wash sinks and Industrial Dishwashers for dishes and sterilization\\nA designated space and table to operate out of each time - never worry about whether you’ll have space to work or not!\\nStations (private and shared) with Dry Storage and Shared Cold Storage\\nRobust Pest Control Program managed by Abel Pest Control\\nA friendly and collaborative environment to work in Support, Encouragement and Business Consultation from the Commissary Connect team\\nSocial Media assistance and access to professional Food photography\\nAbility to rent our pop-up space and food cart (make your own event)\\n Included for each of our member companies is also:\\n\\n \\n\\nClean Rag/Mop service\\nJanitorial Service for common areas\\nBasic kitchen consumables (everything from toilet paper to sanitizer)\\nFree Wi-Fi\\nCooking Line Scheduling Software – check the schedule and your monthly usage on-line – never worry whether the appliance you need is available when you need it and don’t overpay for appliances you never use with bulk “all inclusive” rates. Only pay for what you use!\\nAbility to work out of any Commissary Connect kitchen and access to our network of resources including industry experts, social media & marketing packages and much more.\\nDry storage directly in your station\\n \\n\\nEach of our businesses are assigned to a station that best suits their requirements. You can choose to have a private station – available only for your use at any time and storage for your belongings. Alternatively, you can choose to share a station and reduce costs – this limits your flexibility a little bit as only one company is allowed to use the station at a time, but is a perfect opportunity for new starts or for businesses who don’t need as much time in the kitchen. We work to find people who agree to access the kitchen at different times and days. The storage space and cooler space that is included in the station are also then shared between the two parties.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo enhance our collaborative environment, we have a philosophy to try our best to avoid direct competitors in the same facility. We strive to provide a safe & professional platform and collaborative work environment for small business owners to start, grow and scale their food businesses.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe have added you to our mailing list to keep you up to date on all news relevant to Local Food and our Commissary.

On a tour, we will show you how our system works.\\n\\nHere is some general information:\\n\\n All of our facilities offer:\\n\\n \\n\\n24/7 Access with keypad entrances (never worry about losing a key or fob)\\nVancouver Coastal Health Approval\\nAmple Prep and Hand Wash sinks and Industrial Dishwashers for dishes and sterilization\\nA designated space and table to operate out of each time - never worry about whether you’ll have space to work or not!\\nStations (private and shared) with Dry Storage and Shared Cold Storage\\nRobust Pest Control Program managed by Abel Pest Control\\nA friendly and collaborative environment to work in\\nSupport, Encouragement and Business Consultation from the Commissary Connect team\\nSocial Media assistance and access to professional Food photography\\nAbility to rent our pop-up space and food cart (make your own event)\\n Included for each of our member companies is also:\\n\\n \\n\\nClean Rag/Mop service\\nJanitorial Service for common areas\\nBasic kitchen consumables (everything from toilet paper to sanitizer)\\nFree Wi-Fi\\nCooking Line Scheduling Software – check the schedule and your monthly usage on-line – never worry whether the appliance you need is available when you need it and don’t overpay for appliances you never use with bulk “all inclusive” rates.

You can choose to have a private station – available only for your use at any time and storage for your belongings. Alternatively, you can choose to share a station and reduce costs – this limits your flexibility a little bit as only one company is allowed to use the station at a time, but is a perfect opportunity for new starts or for businesses who don’t need as much time in the kitchen. We work to find people who agree to access the kitchen at different times and days. The storage space and cooler space that is included in the station are also then shared between the two parties.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo enhance our collaborative environment, we have a philosophy to try our best to avoid direct competitors in the same facility. We strive to provide a safe & professional platform and collaborative work environment for small business owners to start, grow and scale their food businesses.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe have added you to our mailing list to keep you up to date on all news relevant to Local Food and our Commissary.

The storage space and cooler space that is included in the station are also then shared between the two parties.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo enhance our collaborative environment, we have a philosophy to try our best to avoid direct competitors in the same facility. We strive to provide a safe & professional platform and collaborative work environment for small business owners to start, grow and scale their food businesses.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe have added you to our mailing list to keep you up to date on all news relevant to Local Food and our Commissary. Stay Connected with us via our social  @commissaryconnect !\\n\\n \\n\\nLooking forward to hearing from you\\n\\n ""}}"

Seeing the space in person is truly the best way to get a feel for how Commissary Connect can support your business and see all our offerings firsthand.\\n\\n \\n\\nWould you be available sometime next week for a visit?

On a tour, we will show you how our system works.\\n\\nHere is some general information:\\n\\n All of our facilities offer:\\n\\n \\n\\n24/7 Access with keypad entrances (never worry about losing a key or fob)\\nVancouver Coastal Health Approval\\nAmple Prep and Hand Wash sinks and Industrial Dishwashers for dishes and sterilization\\nA designated space and table to operate out of each time - never worry about whether you’ll have space to work or not!\\nStations (private and shared) with Dry Storage and Shared Cold Storage\\nRobust Pest Control Program managed by Abel Pest Control\\nA friendly and collaborative environment to work in Support, Encouragement and Business Consultation from the Commissary Connect team\\nSocial Media assistance and access to professional Food photography\\nAbility to rent our pop-up space and food cart (make your own event)\\n Included for each of our member companies is also:\\n\\n \\n\\nClean Rag/Mop service\\nJanitorial Service for common areas\\nBasic kitchen consumables (everything from toilet paper to sanitizer)\\nFree Wi-Fi\\nCooking Line Scheduling Software – check the schedule and your monthly usage on-line – never worry whether the appliance you need is available when you need it and don’t overpay for appliances you never use with bulk “all inclusive” rates.

You can choose to have a private station – available only for your use at any time and storage for your belongings. Alternatively, you can choose to share a station and reduce costs – this limits your flexibility a little bit as only one company is allowed to use the station at a time, but is a perfect opportunity for new starts or for businesses who don’t need as much time in the kitchen. We work to find people who agree to access the kitchen at different times and days. The storage space and cooler space that is included in the station are also then shared between the two parties.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo enhance our collaborative environment, we have a philosophy to try our best to avoid direct competitors in the same facility. We strive to provide a safe & professional platform and collaborative work environment for small business owners to start, grow and scale their food businesses.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe have added you to our mailing list to keep you up to date on all news relevant to Local Food and our Commissary.

We work to find people who agree to access the kitchen at different times and days. The storage space and cooler space that is included in the station are also then shared between the two parties.\\n\\n \\n\\nTo enhance our collaborative environment, we have a philosophy to try our best to avoid direct competitors in the same facility.

My apologies on the delay in sending this.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo as mentioned your needs are not typical for a production environment as you will have bursts of usage and we dont yet know how much stoarge will be required on the day of or in between events.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe easiest way for us to do this is to put you into a package that will still allow VCH to approve your operation. They will typically look for a part time or full time station that can hold all of your required equipment etc. I would suspect that would be at minimum a part time shared station which will give you:\\n\\napprox 20 hours per week\\n1/2 a metro rack of dry storage\\n1 shelf of cold storage.\\n2 staff working in the facility\\nThe rate for this station outside of business hours is $1050 per month on a 1 year contract. This is the most practical way of setting this up.\\n\\n \\n\\na second alternative could be to get you on our smallest package that is essentially 5 hours per week with no overnight storage. This one is for $500 per month (one year contract) However as these packages are very limited in space and time in the kitchen, on the months that you require full access at burst capacity you would pay for a full station which is $3200. The full dedicated station gives you:\\n\\n \\n\\nExclusive, dedicated station (unlimited hours, cookline still based on availability)\\n2 full racks of dry storage\\n1 full rack of cold stoarge\\n4 staff working in facility\\nThis is based on a full station being available when needed so is a bit unorthodox and would require some planning from us. However it would allow for a flexible model that is the lowest cost until a more consistent use can be determined.\\n\\n \\n\\nBoth of these are just my thoughts currenlty as I dont know how much use or adjustment each event will require for the rest of our members. Previously we have just asked caterers to take the space required by VCH but we know that can be difficult as burst capacity storage is different from off season.\\n\\n \\n\\nPlease let me know your thoughts too as I want to be sure this makes sense for us both.\\n\\n \\n\\nLook forward to hearing back.\\n\\n \\n\\nHave a great night,\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n ""}}"

It comes with 2 racks of dry storage and 1 rack of cooler storage. We do have other packages available if you require more or less hours or storage, and we can customize a package based on your requirements. I have attached an agreement as an example for you to review. Let me know when you would like to book a tour.\\n\\nHere are the answers to your questions:\\n\\n1. Availability: Are there vacant slots for renting in your shared ghost kitchen? We are hoping to start operating as early as August 11. \\n\\nYes, we have space available and you will be able to start by August 11th. \\n\\n\\n2. Pricing: Please provide us with the details regarding the rental costs, any associated fees, and the leasing terms. Specifically, we are interested in the full-time plan with either the dedicated station or private kitchen.\\n\\nA full-time station is $3200 per month. You would get a dedicated space that is yours 24/7 365. The only other cost is the cost of using equipment which is around $1 - $2 per hour depending on the piece of equipment. This fee schedule is included in the contract. Please see the attached example agreement for the terms.\\n\\n\\n 3. Equipment and Facilities: It would be great to understand how the kitchen equipment would be divided amongst the several occupants. Will it be split by schedule, or do we work in tandem? In addition, our equipment necessities would include an oven, deep fryer, food processor, commercial mixer, stove, dough sheeter, dry storage, fridge storage, freezer storage, and miscellaneous storage (pizza boxes, takeout containers, etc). We also have a personal dough sheeter and food processor if those are not provided in the kitchen.\\n\\n\\nThe equipment will be mainly split by schedule, although you may login and use the equipment at anytime it is not booked using our patented technology. I can show you how the technology works during a kitchen tour. \\n\\n\\nWe have all the equipment listed above except for the dough sheeter and food processor, so you would have to bring those pieces of equipment. \\n\\n\\nMoreover, we would kindly like further details concerning table arrangement. With a dedicated station or private kitchen, would that entail personal tables and if so, how many? On top of this, we are curious if the facility provides a rest area for downtime, a breakroom if you will. Furthermore, what does the parking situation look like for staff? Is it street parking or perhaps underground parking?\\n\\nYou would get one large prep table included in the full station. You could also bring another table and keep it in your station. There are also multiple shared-use tables in the facility that anyone may use. \\n\\nThere is no dedicated breakroom. There is dedicated parking for Commissary Connect members in our parking and there is also street parking.\\n\\n\\n4. Support and Services: We are interested to know if your team provides any support or services to assist our business in maximizing our potential while operating in the ghost kitchen. For example, marketing assistance will substantially boost our online presence.\\n\\nYes, we promote our members on our social media channels.\\n\\n5. Lease: We are exploring options for short-term and long-term leasing. Please let us know if you offer flexible lease durations to accommodate different business needs. \\n\\n\\nWe are flexible in the lease durations. You may select 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months. \\n\\n\\n6. Online Orders: We understand that the business model of a ghost kitchen values the importance of online orders. Given that we have been in the food industry for 14 years, it is safe to say that we are no strangers to third party online ordering systems such as SkipTheDishes, DoorDash, and UberEats. Our business plan forward would include improving our online menu on these systems and running promotions/discounts to compete with others in our field; with an interest also in marketing to enhance our online presence. On top of this, we have our own website that customers can order from of which we would be improving upon as well.\\n\\nMost of our members use the various online ordering systems to great success as our facilities are strategically located and well-suited for online delivery. \\n\\n\\n 7. Accessibility: Could you provide us with some details about the location’s accessibility for delivery services and customers? With 14 years in the business, we have acquired several regular customers but with a sudden change in location we were wondering if they would continue to be able to pick up their orders from the facility? We believe that our pizza shop business will be a valuable addition to your ghost kitchen community and that our offerings will appeal to a wide range of customers. \\n\\nYes, we have many members doing this, customers can pick-up from our facilities. \\n""}}"
