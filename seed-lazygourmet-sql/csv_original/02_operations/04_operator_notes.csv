There is an instructional video posted on the @milkywaypastry_vancouver Instagram account on how to pick-up products from 417 Industrial Avenue.

 

We would like to remind you that unauthorized access is not permitted in the production facility. It is a breach of contract as per section 2.4 of the Membership Contract, which states:


“Non-production employees, guests or other persons may only access the applicable Kitchen Location(s) with prior notice to and permission from Commissary Connect.”


Please remove the video from Instagram and please do not instruct people on how to access the production facility. If you were giving out your own personal door code, let us know, as we will have to change your code to ensure others do not have it.
